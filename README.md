# MarketPlace E-Commerce Sales Optimization  
### A Two-Part Regression & Statistical Modeling Project

This repository presents a **two-part analytics project series** built on the same real-world e-commerce dataset.  
Together, the two parts demonstrate a complete progression from **core regression modeling and business interpretation** to a **more advanced statistical continuation**, all framed around a consistent business narrative.

The work is designed to mirror how analytics projects evolve in practice—starting with foundational modeling for decision support and extending into deeper statistical evaluation using the same data.

## Business Premise

MarketPlace is a fast-growing online retailer operating across multiple product categories. Leadership wants to understand:

- What drives monthly sales performance
- How effective marketing investments truly are
- How seasonality and product mix influence revenue
- How confidently sales can be forecasted for planning and budgeting

The dataset includes sales, marketing activity, website traffic, pricing competitiveness, customer ratings, inventory levels, social engagement, and categorical variables for season and product type.

## Project Structure (Two-Part Series)

### Part 1 — Sales Drivers & Regression Foundations

**Focus:**  
Identify key drivers of e-commerce sales using multiple regression and translate statistical results into executive-ready insights.

**What this part demonstrates:**
- Dummy variable creation and interpretation
- Full regression model construction
- Global and individual hypothesis testing
- Model comparison and selection
- Business interpretation of coefficients
- Sales prediction with confidence and prediction intervals
- Evaluation of marketing levers using partial tests

**Artifacts included:**
- R Markdown analysis (Part 1 R code)
- Rendered HTML report (interactive)
- Business executive summary (PDF)

### Part 2 — Advanced Statistical Modeling & Inference

**Focus:**  
Extend the initial regression analysis with more advanced statistical techniques using the same dataset and business context.

**What this part demonstrates:**
- Deeper statistical inference and model evaluation
- Advanced hypothesis testing and diagnostics
- Continuation of the original business narrative
- Stronger emphasis on statistical rigor and interpretation

**Artifacts included:**
- R Markdown analysis (Part 2 R code)
- Rendered HTML report (interactive)
- Business-focused executive summary (PDF)
